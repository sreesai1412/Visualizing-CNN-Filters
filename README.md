# Visualizing-CNN-Filters

Several approaches for understanding and visualizing Convolutional Networks have been developed in the literature, partly as a response the criticism that the learned features in a Neural Network are not interpretable.
I have explored some of these approaches in the Jupyter Notebook. These are:

1) Visualizing Filters/Weights
2) Visualizing the maximisation of weights for optimised input value
